# MobIntroCSUSM-CSSI
Hunter recently held an open house for the CSSI (Computer Science Summer Institute) program at CSUSM. As part of this event we introduced the students to both Mob Programming and Angular development.  This respository contains the steps we used to take the students through generating and customizing a new Angular CLI project.  The final solution is provided (the starting point is generating the solution).

The instructions are located in the CSUSMDemontration documents, both PDF and DOCX formats are provided.

# Environment Requirements

The environment to support this demonstration uses these three tools:

•	Atom – this is the code editor that was used in class. (https://Atom.io)  At Hunter we typically use Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com)

•	NodeJS – this is an open source web host that allows you to reference web pages locally. (https://nodejs.org)

•	Angular CLI – the Command Line Interface for Angular.  (https://cli.angular.io/) – note the command line to install this can be run from any folder it’s: “npm i -g @angular/cli”.  These instructions were created with Angular CLI version 6.1.2.

Angular applications are built to create dynamic web applications and turn into HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  This walkthrough focused on CSS and with a small amount of scripting.
